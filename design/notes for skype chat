Notes for meeting with Jason

I'm a sole trader.

I have a registered business.

I know Colin through College, we both studied the same course.

I know a good bit about Olive and what the company does.

Colin has explained the system in detail

The system comes in 3 parts
1. Integration with AcademyHQ system
	- Writing an API
	- Ability to upload modules
2. QA module interface for users
3. Marking interface for admins

Extras I intend to do but won't promise
- Versioning
- Pagination

We've including branding in this, which will be sent over from the academy HQ system.

Talk to Jason about it, show him the mockups and walk him through my thought process.

What will your clients want from this system.

What is the purpose of this system?
